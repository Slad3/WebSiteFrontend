# Slad3.github.io or whatever I want to call it

Frontend for my personal website, hosted on GitHub pages.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to provide public visuals for some of the side projects and data science that I like to do. For example, one night a couple summers ago I downloaded my Facebook data (granted I haven't used Facebook regularly in years), and decided to parse the search results. With this frontend, I can turn the script I used into a backend, connect it with the frontend, and make it publicly available for people to test with their own data.


## Data Science Pages

### Social Media Analyzers

The Social media analyzer allows a user to upload their user data, and recieve back results about the data that their social media sites collects.

All social media analysis pages have message analysis

- Message Analysis: \
With only the timestamps and type of content (aka not reading texts, that's creepy), you can analyze a lot about a conversation such as response time, double texting, sheer amount of messages per person, average messages per day, times per weekday, times per specific hour etc.

#### **Facebook Analyzer**

- **Search History**:\
	Basic analysis on how many times you searched a query, and when you searched the most. It also pulls your top two most popular seraches, and graphs them on a cumulative timeline.

#### **Instagram Analyzer**

- **Account History**:\
	This just diplays an easy to read table of the history of the devices your account was logged into. This includes the IP Address, timestamp, client type, and device ID.

### The Office Script Analyzer

If you've ever though of a quote from a TV show (specifically The Office) but just can't place where it is in the show, you're not alone. This page allows you to enter a quote from the The Office, and see where in the series that quote appears in the series, who said it, and who says it the most in the series.

## Technology

The frontend is made in the Angular framework, using Typesript and raw CSS. Yeah I could've probably used a simpler and lighterweight solution but this is what I started with, and it works for what I want to do with.



Also it seems like every developer has a personal website now days so what the heck. This is a good way to provide a more self-explanitory resume.
